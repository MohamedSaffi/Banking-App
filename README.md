# Banking-App

# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

 This project basically concern about the management of the banking
system which is used to get loan and check the balance amount in the particular person’s
account. So our app helps an individual to operate on this details in our app on his own
account. So this project – BANKING system is developed by INFANT VINOTH P,
GUHAN MPS, MOHAMED SAFFI M. In this project we focussed on only the java
language as a main working tool or programming language to develop this project. Java is
one of the object oriented programs that is easy to use and develop as it has many built in
packages to work with. Here, an individual can maintain both loan and savings account
and notice the progress of both one in the same app. It has the functionality of checking -
the account balance of the individual client of the bank and also his transaction history in
it. It also has the functionality of getting even via this app itself and also to pay the loan
due even. It also has the facility to record the loan progress of an individual. Overall it will
be useful for the client to check his progress or state of his personal savings account or
loan account in the bank. It also has the password security feature for every user which is
default in this app. It is much space efficient as it occupies only 24KB of space in your
hard disk. It contains several classes like login, signup, and transaction etc., these all
classes put together make this application as an working model. As every offline and
queue works has come in online in this decade, this app will be very useful for the client
side as it is easy to use for anyone.

 # PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
 
 As every queue work and offline work for an individual has now
become online. So reduce the load of work for our customer to get loan to pay loan and to
check the account balance to transact the amount even we have developed this app to
make it all possible we have made this application so that the above mentioned jobs can be
done via online rather than the queue in bank.
 
 # FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROJECT:

the app. Next, it has the option for savings account or loan account. And after that if our
choice is loan account it has options for loan balance, new loan and to pay loan. If it is
